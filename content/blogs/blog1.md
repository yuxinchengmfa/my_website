Since we know each other so well, I know it won't complain that I put it in the end. Even though most Germans prefer Munich, Frankfurt is my favorite in Germany. Having lived here for five years, it's almost like my second hometown. The only impression of Frankfurt to many people is probably the airport, but I highly recommend it for long-term residences.
